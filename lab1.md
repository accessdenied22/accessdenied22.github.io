## Introduction

- Attached waterproof thermometer to an embedded microcontroller to continuously sample temperature
- Connected microcontroller with a wireless device to transmit temperature data to the Internet; displayed temperature data from a liquid crystal display (LCD)
- Implemented a web-based interface to:
    1. visualize temperature as graphs of past 120 seconds real-time
    2. wirelessly control LCD   screen
    3. automatically send texts when temperature reaching certain threshold
