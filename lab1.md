# Senior Design Lab 1

## Title
Remotely Accessible Thermometer                         

## Introduction

- Attached waterproof thermometer to an embedded microcontroller to continuously sample temperature
- Connected microcontroller with a wireless device to transmit temperature data to the Internet; displayed temperature data from a liquid crystal display (LCD)
- Implemented a web-based interface to:
    [1] visualize temperature as graphs of past 120 seconds real-time 
    [2] wirelessly control LCD   screen
    [3] automatically send texts when temperature reaching certain threshold
