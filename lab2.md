## Introduction

- Inspected many operational amplifier (op amp) datasheets to design and create a 2nd order Butterworth high pass filter using a Sallen-Key topology
- Designed circuit layout with components incl. infrared phototransistor, buffer, filter, amplifier, and voltage regulator
- Implemented buzzer function and increased detection distance, programming analog-to-digital converter (ADC) in Arduino Uno ith C language; wrote scripts for SMS alerts sending in C language
